For example, a web developer need create a new component instanc.

Suppose the component has been used in current project before:
#+begin_src html
<MyComponent
  attr1="v1"
  attr2="v2"
  attr3="v3"
  attr4="v4"
/>
  <Toolbar>
    <Button onClick={ e => console.log(e) }>
      <i className="fa fa-circle" />
    </Button>
  </Toolbar>
</MyComponent>
#+end_src

That developer only need input =<MyComponent= and run =M-x eacl-complete-tag=. Magic happens!*
* Install
Place =eacl.el= under your [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath][Load Path]]. Then add =(require 'eacl)= to your configuration.

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/][Gnu Grep]], Emacs 24.3 and [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]] are required.

** Linux
GNU Grep should be pre-installed.
** macOS
Please use [[https://brew.sh/][HomeBrew]] to install =GNU Grep= on macOS.

Then insert =(setq eacl-grep-program "ggrep")= into =~/.emacs=. The bundled =BSD Grep= on macOS is too outdated to use.
** Windows
You can use Cygwin/MSYS2 to install =grep= program. Don't forget to add the location of =grep= into environment variable =PATH=.
* Usage
Multiple commands are provided to grep files in the project to get auto complete candidates.

The keyword to grep is the text from line beginning to current cursor.

Project is *automatically* detected if Git/Mercurial/Subversion is used.

You can override the default root directory by setting =eacl-project-root=,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq eacl-project-root "~/projs/PROJECT_DIR")
#+end_src

Here are the commands you can use.
** =M-x eacl-complete-line=
Complete the line. You could assign key binding =C-x C-l= to it.

** =M-x eacl-complete-statement=
Complete the statement which ends with ";".

For example, input text =import= and run this command.
** =M-x eacl-complete-snippet=
Complete the snippet which ends with "}".

For example, input text =if= and run this command.
** =M-x eacl-complete-tag=
Complete the HTML tag which ends with ">".

For example, input text =<div= and run this command.
